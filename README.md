## AI-Enabled Tetris Game

## Project Overview
This project aims to develop a fully functional Tetris game from scratch with an added twist: implementing machine learning to enable an AI to play the game. The primary goals are to first create a robust Tetris game using [Programming Language/Framework] and then develop and train a machine learning model that can strategize and play Tetris on its own.

## Current Status
- [x] It exists and is being worked on.
- [ ] It is done. 

## Features
- some half done code

### Upcoming Features
- A working game
- A working game that plays itself

## Technologies Used
- python
- want to use pytorch but might need to use tensor flow
